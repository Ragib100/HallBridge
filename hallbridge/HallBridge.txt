🏨 Digital Hall Management System (HMS)
– Complete Project Overview
Vision Statement
A streamlined web application that digitizes university residential hall operations with a
"One-Tap" philosophy. The system eliminates paper-based processes while focusing on
three pillars: Flexible Dining (zero food waste), Student Safety (simple movement
tracking), and Hassle-free Administration (automation-first design).

Technical Architecture
Technology Stack
•

Frontend/Backend: Next.js 14+ (App Router + API Routes)

•
•
•
•
•
•

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Automation: Vercel Cron Jobs
Payments: Stripe/Mobile Banking
Validation: Zod
Progressive Web App: PWA support for offline functionality

Architecture Philosophy: Serverless, scalable, single codebase for both frontend and
backend.

User Roles (Simplified to 3 Tiers)
1. Hall Admin (Provost/Office Head)
Responsibilities:

•
•

Approve new student registrations
Final authority on room allocations/swaps

•
•
•
•

View financial dashboards (income vs. expenses)
Receive emergency SOS alerts
Export monthly reports (PDF/Excel)
Access audit logs (who changed what, when)

2. Operations Staff (Unified Role)
Includes: Mess Manager, Maintenance Workers, Laundry Staff
Mess Management Permissions:
•
•
•
•
•

View daily "Meals ON" count for next day
Upload and edit weekly menus
Log daily market expenses
Manage voting system for meal choices
Verify meal tokens during disputes

Maintenance Permissions:
•
•
•

View pending maintenance requests
Update task status (Pending → In Progress → Fixed)
Manage laundry workflow (Given → Washing → Ready)

Why Unified: Simplifies system, reduces redundant logins, reflects real-world overlap in
small halls.

3. Student (The End User)
Permissions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Toggle meals ON/OFF
Create and view gate passes
Pay bills online
Submit maintenance complaints with photos
Request roommates for annual room changes
Vote on weekly menu options
Rate meals (thumbs up/down)

•
•

Book common facilities
Post/search lost & found items

•

Request guest meals

Core Modules
🍽️ Module 1: Smart Mess & Dining System
A. Menu Management
Base Weekly Menu:
•
•

Operations Staff uploads standard menu for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner
Visible to all students on dashboard

Democratic Voting System:
•
•
•

Every week, students vote on specific dish options (e.g., "Chicken Curry vs. Beef
Bhuna")
Winning option gets added to next week's menu
Promotes engagement and satisfaction

Quality Control:
•
•

Post-meal rating: Thumbs Up/Down
Consistently poor ratings flag the cook/vendor for Admin review

B. Meal Toggle System (The Core Innovation)
Student Dashboard:
•
•

Simple ON/OFF switch: [Tomorrow's Meal: ON/OFF]
Shows next 7 days in calendar view

Automated Cutoff:
•

Hard deadline: 11:00 PM the night before

•
•

Cron job automatically locks the toggle at cutoff time
Example: To skip Friday lunch, must toggle OFF by Thursday 11 PM

Backend Logic:
Daily Meal Count = Total Students with "Meal ON" for Tomorrow
Operations Staff Dashboard shows: "Tomorrow: 87 students eating"

Billing Impact:
•
•

Meal ON: Daily rate added to monthly bill
Meal OFF: $0 charge for that day

•

Formula: Monthly Meal Cost = (Number of ON days) × (Daily Rate)

Operations Staff Benefit:
•

Knows exact quantity to purchase

•
•

Prevents over-buying groceries
Reduces food waste to near zero

C. Digital Token System
QR Code Verification:
•
•
•

Each student has unique QR code in app
At dining counter, staff scans student's QR
System checks: Is meal ON for today?
o Yes: Green screen, entry allowed
o No: Red screen, entry denied

Prevents: Students who toggled OFF from eating (maintains fairness)

🛡️ Module 2: Security & Movement Tracking
A. Digital Gate Pass System
Check-Out Process (Leaving Hall):
1. Student opens app, clicks "Create Gate Pass"
2. Fills 3-field form:
a. Destination: Text field (e.g., "Home", "Library", "Downtown")
b. Reason: Dropdown (Vacation, Medical, Family Event, Outing, Academic)
c. Expected Return: Date + Time picker
3. Clicks "Submit"
4. System generates pass with timestamp
5. Status changes to "Outside Hall"
Guard Verification (Low-Tech Solution):
•
•

•

Student shows phone screen at gate
Screen displays Big Green Animated Badge with:
o Student name and photo
o Destination
o Current timestamp (live, can't be screenshot)
Guard visually verifies, no login needed

Check-In Process (Returning):
•
•
•
•

Option 1: Scan static QR code posted at hall gate
Option 2: Click "I'm Back" button in app
System logs return time
Status changes to "Inside Hall"

Safety Automation:
•

If student doesn't check in by expected return time:
o System sends alert to Hall Admin
o SMS/Push notification: "Student X hasn't returned, expected at 6 PM"

B. Visitor Management
Digital Visitor Log:
•

Guard (or student) enters visitor details:
o Name, purpose, student being visited
o Optional: Photo capture

•
•

Creates timestamped record
Admin can view all active visitors

Summary
The Digital HMS replaces fragmented paper processes with a unified, intelligent system.
The 3-role structure (Admin, Operations Staff, Student) keeps it simple while the meal
toggle system creates unprecedented transparency and cost savings. By combining
modern web technology with human-centered design, this system makes hall life better for
everyone—students save money, staff save time, and administrators gain total visibility.
The One-Tap Philosophy: Every major action (toggle meal, create gate pass, pay bill,
report issue) is no more than 3 clicks away.
